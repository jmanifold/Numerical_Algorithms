# Description
Algorithm performs the Simpson's intergration method for an inputted data set.
## How to use
There must be two data sets for the X and Y positions; the X data points must be equally spaced or the program will return an error. If there is an odd number of data points, the algorithm performs an additional trapaziodial integration for the remaining data set. This provides a reliable approximation without needing to find the integral.
