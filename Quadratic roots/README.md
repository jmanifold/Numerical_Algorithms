# Description
This algorithm uses a modified quadratic formula to find the roots for quadratic funcitons. The code takes advantage of the discriminate, the value under the square root, of the quadratic formula to determine the number of roots found.
## How to use
The code requires the coefficients of the function to run. Once these are entered, the code will print the root/roots if any and return them to variables.
