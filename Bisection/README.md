# Description
This code uses the bisection method to approximate the root of an inputted funciton.
## How to use
This code uses five inputs: the function, lower guess, upper guess, the error approximation minimum, and the maximum number of iterations allotted. If only the function, upper guess, and lower guess are inputted, the algorithm uses defult inputs of .0001% for the error minimum and 200 iterations for the maximum iterations. If used correctly, the code will print the estimated root, the value at the guess, the approximated error of the guess, and how many iterations it took to reach this root
